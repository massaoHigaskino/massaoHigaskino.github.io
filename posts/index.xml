      <description>As the long title says, I have a very specific case to show. I have got a German MacBook Pro and frequently need to write in Portuguese. It works well under macOS. However, the default keyboard layout on Linux Mint is not quite the same (titled Deutsch (Macintosh)). This makes quite difficulty to type characters with tilde (e.g. ã, õ) and cedillas (e.g. ç). Along this post I will show you how to change the Deutsch (Macintosh) keyboard layout to allow you to type those characters.
The keyboard layouts on Linux Mint are defined by text files located in /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols and every German layout is defined inside the de file.</description>

      <description>About me I am a developer who have been working with a broad assortment of technologies, but mostly focused in backend written in Java.
I have always been looking for working with diverse groups, as it brings different mindsets together, which reinforces our constant need to learn and adapt.
I just started working in Portugal as consultant for IT businesses, and I am looking forward to the new challenges it will bring up.
